# GameOfLife
John Conway's game of life implementation in C++.

Program was coded using SFML 2.5.1 for MinGW on CodeBlocks 20.03.

## Rules (via Wikipedia)
Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

-Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

-Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

-Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

-Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Controls
-Pressing <b>LMB</b> on a cell causes its state to change

-Pressing <b>SPACE</b> updates the board (moves to next generation)

-Pressing <b>C</b> clears the board

-Pressing <b>ESC</b> closes the game

## Feel free to use my code :)
